My interest on this topic started when I did my master’s thesis on rainfall prediction on agriculture using mathematical modeling. I have been looking for a software that is economical (if not free) to be used in my data analysis. That time, my wife had a collaboration research project with the UP School of Statistics headed by the former Dean Dr. Erniel Barrios. I had the opportunity to meet the members of the team who are seasoned and high-caliber statisticians. I did not waste time. I took the chance to inquire about my master’s thesis, and so Dr. Barrios introduced me to R, which UP School of Statistics uses for free -- it is open source and anybody can access it without even buying a license. Dr Barrios was even so generous enough to give me e-materials for this purpose. 

As a result, even though I first coded my analysis in Mathematica, I was later able to code my thesis in R using RStudio. With much enthusiasm to learn RStudio, I was able to explore more the field of time series analysis. Then, I was able to use it as a statistical computing tool for multiple linear regression. Later, I found my self using RStudio in making handouts, examinations, and even reports as a teacher, and answering home works, doing computations, and also making reports as a student. During my course work in my Doctor of Philosophy course, we used SPSS. I compared the use of SPSS with the use of RStudio. I found out that every computation in SPSS has a counterpart in RStudio.
