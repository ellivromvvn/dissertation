# INTRODUCTION

## The Problem and its Background

The covid 19 pandemic.

Flexible learning.

R's role in flexible learning.

The effects of using R [@R] and RStudio [@RStudio] on pre-service teachers' coding and data management and on instructional materials design will be investigated in this paper.

The entire world has been devastated by the COVID 19 pandemic. Since it started, we have been in a public health emergency and everyone has been concerned with public safety. Measures taken by the government have drastically changed the normal state of practice in all offices. In the education sector, face to face classroom set up is no longer being practiced. The Commission on Higher Education implemented flexible learning to cope up with this situation [@CMO_04_20]. However, instruction through flexible learning is very challenging. The Commission on Higher Education stated in the guidelines that "the main objective should be to provide learners with the most flexibility on the learning content, schedules, access, and innovative assessment, making use of digital and non-digital tools" (p. 3). Teachers need to be creative in able to device new ways to be effective in implementing flexible learning.

"R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics" [@R]. It is open source and can be used in a wide array of statistical (linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.) and graphical techniques that can be extended with the use packages. Currently there are 16,732 packages available for various statistical computations and other tasks. According to the R Core Team; "one of Râ€™s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed". R has recently gained popularity in universities and research institutes and is currently 8th in the August, 2020 TIOBE's index for programming language popularity from being 20th last year mainly due to its being open source and its use in the COVID 19 research and analytics [@whitney20]. Using R is a practical application of coding and it is an essential tool for data management. It is also a great tool for instructional materials design in mathematics subjects.

On the other hand, RStudio has made the use or R easy, manageable, and and even more extensible. "RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R" [@RStudio]. It is also open source. RStudio includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor for direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. Furthermore, RStudio has integrated support for version control systems like Git [@chacon20] that can lead to the use of GitHub [@github]; a website that host code repositories for collaboration. Recently, RStudio cloud [@rstudiocloud] was created to support the use of RStudio directly from the web browser without the hardware hassles. It is designed for instructors and students for the purpose of teaching and learning data science with RStudio. 

R and RStudio presents a very powerful and economical tool to teach and learn mathematics. It is a potential tool to teach Mathematics in the Modern World; the only mathematics subject taught in all courses being a general education subject. Mathematics in the Modern world is a subject that gives all college students the foundation for the application of mathematics in their daily lives [@MMW]. In the sample syllabus, learning outcomes are classified into three; knowledge, skills, and values. Under knowledge: 1) Discuss and argue about the nature of mathematics, what it is, how it is expressed, represented and used, 2) Use different types of reasoning to justify statements and arguments made about mathematics and mathematical concepts, 3) Discuss the language and symbols of mathematics. Under skills: 1) Use a variety of statistical tools to process and manage numerical data, 2) Analyze codes and coding schemes used for identification, privacy, and security purposes, 3) use mathematics in other areas such as finance, voting, health and medicine, business, environment, arts and design, and recreation. For values: 1) Appreciate the nature and uses of mathematics in everyday life, 2) Affirm honesty and integrity in the application of mathematics to various human endeavors. However, It is quite surprising that the popularity of R and RStudio among academicians in the province is very minimal.

The teaching of data management can really be challenging in this situation; implementing flexible learning. Although Data Management is just a part of the general education subject Mathematics in the Modern World, it is very crucial to make the students' learning experience meaningful since data management is very useful in a world where data is really abundant. The use of software in this regard will introduce the student to powerful tools that will really help them give meaning to data that they encounter in their jobs and daily lives. To reiterate this, the text book used in  Mathematics in the Modern World at Nueva Vizcaya State University (NVSU) states that going through Data Management, students should be able to:

1. Use a variety of statistical tools to process and manage numerical data;

2. Use the methods of linear regression and correlation to predict the value of a variable given certain conditions; and

3. Advocate the use of statistical data in making important decisions [@reyes18, p. 83].

The next section will highlight the necessity of this study in a bigger context.

## Rationale





The advancement brought about by the 4th industrial revolution led to fast and powerful computers that are no longer expensive. This development led to big data and thus advances in the field of statistics, machine learning and deep learning paving way to data science as a field. Moreover, computing has become an essential part

The practice of statistics is computational; statistical computing software are mainly used. Currently, at the b 4th industrial revolution brought big data, the advancement of machine learning and deep learn

ingWith the emergence of data science as a field due to big data, machine learning and powerful computers that are no longer expensive all brought about by the 4th industrial revolution, it is very fitting to consider how statistics education should adapt to these changes and be relevant in the practice of statistics. In this regard, in 2005, @franklin07 put forth the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) Report recommending a framework for statistics education both in the k to 12 and college level. In 2016, the @GCR16 revisited the effectiveness of the framework and still found it effective. The framework is now the standard in statistics education in the United States and in many countries that adopted it [@zieffler18].

In the GAISE report, one noteworthy recommendation is "the use of technology to explore concepts and analyze data" [@GCR16, p. 3]. Studies have shown that the use of technology can really improve statistics education; equipping learners with relevant data skills and effective powerful tools in this era where data is very much abundant [@doi16; @chance06; @chance07; @harraway12; @CR17; @stander17].  However, when it comes to software used in doing statistical computing and teaching statistics, there is no single statistical computing tool that fits all statistical tasks [@mcnamara18]. Nonetheless, introductory statistics students should be taught a common statistical computing software such as SAS, SPSS, or R, enthusing them to continuously learn statistics technology since statistical tools are diverse and eventually evolve through time [@gould18a]. Moreover, @gould10, @horton15a, @horton15 and @hardin15 pointed out the importance of developing among students -- with the use of statistical computing software -- data management skills in introductory and second courses in statistics.

In our country, leading universities are addressing this issue and have already integrated the use of technology in their curriculum for statistics education. The University of the Philippines for example uses a number of software in its introductory statistics courses and statistics courses (e.g.. R with RStudio, Python, SAS, SPSS, Stata, MS Excel, QGIS, ArcGIS, Gephi, yEd Graph Editor, and more). Most of the software used are open source.   

In the province, some universities have acquired SPSS to teach statistics courses. On the other hand, some still use calculators to do and teach statistical computing. Unfortunately, both setup do not lessen the gap between statistics education and statistical practice. In reality, most institutions to which graduates from these universities get employed cannot afford SPSS. The use of SPSS requires a paid license. One can choose MS Excel as an alternative, however its functions are limited [@biehler13].

Faced with the pandemic brought about by COVID19,  the use of software in teaching statistics has become even more challenging than ever here in the province. This can be attributed to the fact that not all students can afford a laptop or a desktop, poor internet connection to no internet connection, and pedagogical challenges as a consequence of the previous two.

In this context, in an attempt to improve statistics education and the practice of statistics in NVSU, to provide a powerful tool to teach and practice statistics to future statistics teachers in the province, and to provide an alternative way of teaching statistics during the implementation of flexible learning in times of pandemic, the researcher will introduce the use of R with RStudio to the BSEd Mathematics and BS Mathematics students in their Data Management class. Then the researcher will see if there is a significant change in their performance in the class. Finally, the researcher will identify themes and categories that will anchor the study to the bigger context of statistics education and thereby serve as departure points as basis for policies that will lead to curriculum, instruction and assessment development with respect to statistics education in NVSU specially with flexible learning.

## Statement of the Problem

To adapt to the changes in technology brought about by the 4th industrial revolution, to be abreast with the global community when it comes to statistics education, and to address the pedagogical challenges brought about by flexible learning in teaching statistics in times of pandemic, RStudio as a statistical computing tool in learning data management will be introduced to BSEd Mathematics and BS Mathematics students of NVSU. The researcher will then answer the following questions after gathering profile variables, employing a two group counterbalanced measures design, and letting the students share their stories and narratives in using R and SPSS through essay:

1. What are the profile variables of the respondents?

2. What are the pre-test scores of the respondents?

3. What are the first and second post-test scores of the respondents?

4. Is there significant difference in the pre-test scores among the respondents in both groups?

5. Is there significant difference in the first post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores?

6. Is there significant difference in the second post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores?

7. What are the categories and themes on the narratives of the participants in using R and SPSS?

## Hypotheses

Is there a significant difference in the pre-test scores among the respondents in both groups?

>H~0~: There is no significant difference in the pre-test scores among the respondents in both groups.

>H~a~: There is significant difference in the pre-test scores among the respondents in both groups.

Is there significant difference in the first post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores?

>H~0~: There is no significant difference in the first post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores.

>H~a~: There is significant difference in the first post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores.

Is there significant difference in the second post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores?

>H~0~: There is no significant difference in the second post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores.

>H~a~: There is significant difference in the second post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores.

## Significance of the Study

This study is significant to universities and administrators since it will enlighten them to invest in free software which is more economical yet even at par with other leading statistical software. This is also important to faculty members who teach statistics and do research since it gives them a glimpse of what is happening in statistics education and in practice. Lastly, this study is significant to students for them to be able to see the practicality and applicability of other statistical software like R using RStudio.

## Scope and Delimitation

The focus of the study is to see the effect of using RStudio to the performance of students in their Data Management class. The respondents will be the BSEd Mathematics and BS Mathematics students taking up Mathematics in the Modern World in the first semester of school year 2020-2021 at Nueva Vizcaya State University Bayombong Campus. The study will also identify themes and categories that will anchor the study to the bigger context of statistics education and thereby serve as departure points as basis for policies that will lead to curriculum, instruction and assessment development with respect to statistics education in NVSU specially with flexible learning.

## Conceptual and Analytical Framework

Using RStudio in teaching statistics with flexible learning, four concepts were identified.

1. Technology Pedagogy Content Knowledge (TPCK) [@mishra06]. According to Mishra and Koehler, the introduction of new technology reconstructs the dynamic equilibrium among technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge. Flexible learning has changed the face of using technology in education. In this situation, it is very critical and important that teachers should rethink their technology, pedagogy and content knowledge.

2. Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) College Report 2016 [@GCR16]. The report enumerated six recommendations: 1) Teach statistical thinking. 2) Focus on conceptual understanding. 3) Integrate real data with a context and purpose. 4) Foster active learning. 5) Use technology to explore concepts and analyze data. 6) Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning. It is with these recommendations that statistics education can be improved. However, it can be really challenging to adopt these recommendations with flexible learning.

3. Reproducibility. The use of RStudio actually promotes reproducibility since it is a tool designed for reproducible research [@gandrud20]. The use of RStudio will help teachers create reproducible documents and analysis that can be easily reproduced by students. Reproducibility will play a huge role in overcoming the pedagogical challenges posed by flexible learning in teaching statistics.

4. Bridging the gap between tools for learning and doing statistics [@mcnamara15]. This has been the challenge in statistics education through the years. And it can be even more challenging now with flexible learning. RStudio can help with this with its capabilities for reproducible research. RStudio is designed for statistics education and also for the practice of statistics.

Statistics education is currently under flexible learning. In this study, technology will be integrated to statistics education. Figure 1 shows the analytical framework of the study. The analytical framework is input process output. The interaction among statistics education, flexible learning, and technology will be the input. Then through quantitative and qualitative methods, policies on curriculum, instruction, and assessment development will be the output.

## Definition of Terms

- **statistics education** - refers to the curriculum, instruction, and assessment in the teaching and learning of statistics.



# RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

## Research Design

The research design will be a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. For the quantitative method, a two group counterbalanced measures design will be employed. The two groups are already intact and there will be no randomization. A pre-test will be conducted to both groups. Then group 1 will use RStudio and group 2 will use SPSS for the first topic. A post-test will then follow. Then group 1 will then use SPSS and group 2 will use RStudio for the second topic. Another post test will follow. Figure 2 shows the diagram of the two group counterbalanced measures design to be employed. Both post-tests will be compared to see if there is significant difference in the scores of both groups.

![**Figure 2.** Two Group Counterbalanced Measures Design](CBD.png)

The qualitative method will focus on the narratives and experiences of the participants to come up with categories and themes that will anchor the study to the bigger context of statistics education and thereby serve as departure points to craft policies that will lead to curriculum, instruction and assessment development with respect to statistics education in NVSU specially with flexible learning.

## Research Environment

The research will be conducted in Nueva Vizcaya State University at Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya.

## Research Respondents

The respondents of the study are BSEd Mathematics students and BS Mathematics students of NVSU taking Data Management class in their Mathematics in the Modern World subject during the first semester of the the school year 2020-2021.

## Instruments

The research instrument will be a survey questionnaire for the profile variables.

## Data Gathering Procedure

Data for test scores will be gathered by conducting a pre-test and two post-tests. Narratives and experiences on using RStudio and SPSS will be gathered through an essay question to be answered by the respondents. The essay question will also come with the survey questionnaire for the profile variables.

## Treatment of Data

Descriptive statistics will be computed for the profile variables. For the first hypothesis, independent samples *t*-test on pre-test mean scores on both groups will be computed. For the second and third hypotheses, one way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be computed, with the two post-test scores as the dependent variable, grouping variable as the independent variable and pre-test scores as the covariate. All computations will be done in RStudio.
