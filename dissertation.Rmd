# INTRODUCTION

## Rationale

The advancement brought about by the 4th industrial revolution led to fast and powerful computers that are no longer expensive. This development led to big data and thus advances in the field of statistics, machine learning and deep learning paving way to data science as a field. Moreover, computing has become an essential part

The practice of statistics is computational; statistical computing software are mainly used. Currently, at the b 4th industrial revolution brought big data, the advancement of machine learning and deep learn

ingWith the emergence of data science as a field due to big data, machine learning and powerful computers that are no longer expensive all brought about by the 4th industrial revolution, it is very fitting to consider how statistics education should adapt to these changes and be relevant in the practice of statistics. In this regard, in 2005, @franklin07 put forth the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) Report recommending a framework for statistics education both in the k to 12 and college level. In 2016, the @GCR16 revisited the effectiveness of the framework and still found it effective. The framework is now the standard in statistics education in the United States and in many countries that adopted it [@zieffler18].

In the GAISE report, one noteworthy recommendation is "the use of technology to explore concepts and analyze data" [@GCR16, p. 3]. Studies have shown that the use of technology can really improve statistics education; equipping learners with relevant data skills and effective powerful tools in this era where data is very much abundant [@doi16; @chance06; @chance07; @harraway12; @CR17; @stander17].  However, when it comes to software used in doing statistical computing and teaching statistics, there is no single statistical computing tool that fits all statistical tasks [@mcnamara18]. Nonetheless, introductory statistics students should be taught a common statistical computing software such as SAS, SPSS, or R, enthusing them to continuously learn statistics technology since statistical tools are diverse and eventually evolve through time [@gould18a]. Moreover, @gould10, @horton15a, @horton15 and @hardin15 pointed out the importance of developing among students -- with the use of statistical computing software -- data management skills in introductory and second courses in statistics.

In our country, leading universities are addressing this issue and have already integrated the use of technology in their curriculum for statistics education. The University of the Philippines for example uses a number of software in its introductory statistics courses and statistics courses (e.g.. R with RStudio, Python, SAS, SPSS, Stata, MS Excel, QGIS, ArcGIS, Gephi, yEd Graph Editor, and more). Most of the software used are open source.   

In the province, some universities have acquired SPSS to teach statistics courses. On the other hand, some still use calculators to do and teach statistical computing. Unfortunately, both setup do not lessen the gap between statistics education and statistical practice. In reality, most institutions to which graduates from these universities get employed cannot afford SPSS. The use of SPSS requires a paid license. One can choose MS Excel as an alternative, however its functions are limited [@biehler13].

Faced with the pandemic brought about by COVID19,  the use of software in teaching statistics has become even more challenging than ever here in the province. This can be attributed to the fact that not all students can afford a laptop or a desktop, poor internet connection to no internet connection, and pedagogical challenges as a consequence of the previous two.

In this context, in an attempt to improve statistics education and the practice of statistics in NVSU, to provide a powerful tool to teach and practice statistics to future statistics teachers in the province, and to provide an alternative way of teaching statistics during the implementation of flexible learning in times of pandemic, the researcher will introduce the use of R with RStudio to the BSEd Mathematics and BS Mathematics students in their Data Management class. Then the researcher will see if there is a significant change in their performance in the class. Finally, the researcher will identify themes and categories that will anchor the study to the bigger context of statistics education and thereby serve as departure points as basis for policies that will lead to curriculum, instruction and assessment development with respect to statistics education in NVSU specially with flexible learning.

## Statement of the Problem/Objectives

To adapt to the changes in technology brought about by the 4th industrial revolution, to be abreast with the global community when it comes to statistics education, and to address the pedagogical challenges brought about by flexible learning in teaching statistics in times of pandemic, RStudio as a statistical computing tool in learning data management will be introduced to BSEd Mathematics and BS Mathematics students of NVSU. The researcher will then answer the following questions after gathering profile variables, employing a two group counterbalanced measures design, and letting the students share their stories and narratives in using R and SPSS through essay:

1. What are the profile variables of the respondents?

2. What are the pre-test scores of the respondents?

3. What are the first and second post-test scores of the respondents?

4. Is there significant difference in the pre-test scores among the respondents in both groups?

5. Is there significant difference in the first post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores?

6. Is there significant difference in the second post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores?

7. What are the categories and themes on the narratives of the participants in using R and SPSS?

## Statement of Null Hypotheses

Is there a significant difference in the pre-test scores among the respondents in both groups?

>H~0~: There is no significant difference in the pre-test scores among the respondents in both groups.

>H~a~: There is significant difference in the pre-test scores among the respondents in both groups.

Is there significant difference in the first post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores?

>H~0~: There is no significant difference in the first post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores.

>H~a~: There is significant difference in the first post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores.

Is there significant difference in the second post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores?

>H~0~: There is no significant difference in the second post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores.

>H~a~: There is significant difference in the second post-test scores among the respondents in both groups based on their pre-test scores.

## Theoretical Framework

## Conceptual and Analytical Framework

Using RStudio in teaching statistics with flexible learning, four concepts were identified.

1. Technology Pedagogy Content Knowledge (TPCK) [@mishra06]. According to Mishra and Koehler, the introduction of new technology reconstructs the dynamic equilibrium among technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge. Flexible learning has changed the face of using technology in education. In this situation, it is very critical and important that teachers should rethink their technology, pedagogy and content knowledge.

2. Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) College Report 2016 [@GCR16]. The report enumerated six recommendations: 1) Teach statistical thinking. 2) Focus on conceptual understanding. 3) Integrate real data with a context and purpose. 4) Foster active learning. 5) Use technology to explore concepts and analyze data. 6) Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning. It is with these recommendations that statistics education can be improved. However, it can be really challenging to adopt these recommendations with flexible learning.

3. Reproducibility. The use of RStudio actually promotes reproducibility since it is a tool designed for reproducible research [@gandrud20]. The use of RStudio will help teachers create reproducible documents and analysis that can be easily reproduced by students. Reproducibility will play a huge role in overcoming the pedagogical challenges posed by flexible learning in teaching statistics.

4. Bridging the gap between tools for learning and doing statistics [@mcnamara15]. This has been the challenge in statistics education through the years. And it can be even more challenging now with flexible learning. RStudio can help with this with its capabilities for reproducible research. RStudio is designed for statistics education and also for the practice of statistics.

Statistics education is currently under flexible learning. In this study, technology will be integrated to statistics education. Figure 1 shows the analytical framework of the study. The analytical framework is input process output. The interaction among statistics education, flexible learning, and technology will be the input. Then through quantitative and qualitative methods, policies on curriculum, instruction, and assessment development will be the output.

# RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

## Research Design

The research design will be a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. For the quantitative method, a two group counterbalanced measures design will be employed. The two groups are already intact and there will be no randomization. A pre-test will be conducted to both groups. Then group 1 will use RStudio and group 2 will use SPSS for the first topic. A post-test will then follow. Then group 1 will then use SPSS and group 2 will use RStudio for the second topic. Another post test will follow. Figure 2 shows the diagram of the two group counterbalanced measures design to be employed. Both post-tests will be compared to see if there is significant difference in the scores of both groups.

![**Figure 2.** Two Group Counterbalanced Measures Design](CBD.png)

The qualitative method will focus on the narratives and experiences of the participants to come up with categories and themes that will anchor the study to the bigger context of statistics education and thereby serve as departure points to craft policies that will lead to curriculum, instruction and assessment development with respect to statistics education in NVSU specially with flexible learning.

## Research Environment

The research will be conducted in Nueva Vizcaya State University at Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya.

## Research Respondents

The respondents of the study are BSEd Mathematics students and BS Mathematics students of NVSU taking Data Management class in their Mathematics in the Modern World subject during the first semester of the the school year 2020-2021.

## Instruments

The research instrument will be a survey questionnaire for the profile variables.

## Data Gathering Procedure

Data for test scores will be gathered by conducting a pre-test and two post-tests. Narratives and experiences on using RStudio and SPSS will be gathered through an essay question to be answered by the respondents. The essay question will also come with the survey questionnaire for the profile variables.

## Treatment of Data

Descriptive statistics will be computed for the profile variables. For the first hypothesis, independent samples *t*-test on pre-test mean scores on both groups will be computed. For the second and third hypotheses, one way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be computed, with the two post-test scores as the dependent variable, grouping variable as the independent variable and pre-test scores as the covariate. All computations will be done in RStudio.
